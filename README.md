# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
This project was created using Python 3.12.3

To experiment with your own books, you can use [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to grab the contents of public-domain books.

Usage:
1. git clone https://github.com/BrandonAbe/bookbot, or download the .zip file

2. navigate to desired book within Project gutenberg
3. create a new .txt file within the project directory
4. paste the raw text contents of the book into the .txt file you created and save the file
5. within your terminal, execute "python3 main.py <path_to_book>
6. Enjoy the report that is generated!
